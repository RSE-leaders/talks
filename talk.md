The problems facing research software are well known
----------------------------------------------------

* Low levels of reuse
* Poor standard of verification

Technical solutions to technical problems
-----------------------------------------

The e-Research community has spent a long time trying to
find technical solutions

* Research software distributions
* Grid
* Middleware
* Workflows

These have had limited adoption in research communities.

Social solutions to technical problems
---------------------------------------

We hypothesise that social innnovation is needed

* A new role in the academic system focused on research software
* Combines the best of the Craftsperson and the Scholar

Social innovation in centuries-old institutions is hard

Why a new role?
---------------

Alternative approaches:

* Reward good research software using traditional academic incentives:
  * Recognise software as an academic output
  * Reject submissions with unreproducible computational software
  * Funder mandates

Advantages of RSE Groups
------------------------

* Can lead on training and teaching in reproducible computational research
* Good for researchers who *don't* want to be programmers
* Synergies with research computing platforms

What is a Research Software Group?
----------------------------------

* Collaborates with researchers to build Sustainable Software
* Delivers teaching in reproducible computational research
* Measured on research software output and quality
* Can be part of Research Computing / IT, or faculty
* Not independent researchers, but research background

Timeline
-------

* February 2012: Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) Collaborations Workshop, agrees on "Research Software Engineer" title. (Also considered Scientific Programmer, research software developer, etc...)
* SSI begins Research Software Engineers Campaign
* September 2012: University College London founds Research Software Development Team, 3 centrally funded posts

Timeline
--------

* September 2013: Founding, UK Community of Research Software Engineers
* Autumn 2013: First grant-funded work in UCL, research groups costing research programmers into grants
* Spring 2014: Launch of ARCHER embedded Computational Science and Engineering Call
* March 2014: First grant-funded recruitment in UCL team
* Winter 2014: UCL group grows to six through further grant
  collaborations from History to Radio Astronomy.

Timeline
--------

* Spring 2015: Research Software Groups founded in Manchester,
  Southampton, Sheffield
* Spring 2015: Workshop on future of UK Cyberinfrastructure
  recommends software support as critical component
* Summer 2015: EPSRC announces first Research Software Engineering
  Fellowships
* Summer 2015: Activity towards founding of RSE groups in
  Cambridge, Oxford, Bristol, Imperial

The EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellowships
---------------------------------------------------

UK Research Council Fellowships:

   * Most common route to permanent position
   * ~Â£1M, 5 years plus staff

RSE Fellowships:

   * Can be used to found research software groups
   * Expect to award 3-4
   * > 200 Applicants!

The Future
----------

* RSE groups in most research-intensive universities?
* Work sharing between groups?
* Faculty and department posts?
* RSE role recognised outside UK?
